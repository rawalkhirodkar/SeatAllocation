Rest labs are just academic stuff but Lab10 is special.
We here implemented an algorithm in Java which allocates Students seats in Colleges according to the Merit-List.
(Of course taking into consideration the Category they belong to, along with reservation quota in a College)

This is essentially the same process used to allocate seats in IIT-JEE and NIT Entrance exams.

At the heart of the algorithm is Gale-Shapley Matching.
Java was choosen as the language for development to encourage scalability.
